Stylesheet: Mixins & Constants Stylesheet

This is where you can take advantage of LESS' great features: 
Mixins & Constants. I won't go in-depth on how they work exactly,
there are a few articles below that will help do that. What I will
tell you is that this will help speed up simple changes like
changing a color or adding CSS3 techniques like box shadow and
border-radius.

A WORD OF WARNING: It's very easy to overdo it here. Be careful and
remember less is more.
